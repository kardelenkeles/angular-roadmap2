Performance: Faster	/ Needs Improvement

SEO: More SEO-friendly / Does not contain elements that make websites crawlable

Testing: Allows unit testing with Karma, while Angular CLI helps with testing during app building / Requires third-party tools for testing and error detection

Ease of Project Management: Follows a structured format that makes Angular projects easier to manage / Lacks structure, which is why AngularJS projects are tough to maintain

Examples of Real-World Applications: Upwork, Gmail, Wikiwand, etc. / Netflix, iStock, AngularJS, Lego, etc.
